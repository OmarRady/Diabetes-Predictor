# Diabetes-Predictor
In this project, I have used Azure Machine Learning to train and evaluate a classification model. This required me to explore and prepare the data for modeling through feature engineering and normalization, splitting the data into training and test datasets, and evaluating performance metrics for classification. I published this predictive model as a web service (Still without front-end ) you can also consume it from Excel as well as from a custom client application.

<<IMPORTANT!>> 

#This project is an exercise lab from Microsoft Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence

#The data used in the exercise was generated by a simulation based on the data in the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset published by the University of California, School of Information and Computer Science 

#70% of the dataset was used for the training and the rest for testing

#ZScore (mean-variance), and MinMax were used to normalize the data

#The Age column in the dataset is skewed because most patients are in the youngest age bracket. Creating a version of this feature that uses a natural log (Ln) transformation can help create a more linear relationship between Age and other features, and improve the ability to predict the Diabetic label

#Two Class Logistic Regression is the training module 

#You can contact me for more details/source code.
